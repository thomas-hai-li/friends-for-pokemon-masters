# Friends for Pokémon Masters
A stupid simple friend-finding app for the Pokémon Masters mobile game, built in a weekend!

**To Run:** You can't run the app from cloning the repo (I've redacted the Firebase API keys womp womp) but you can download it from Google Play.

**Screenshots:** Initial sign-up page, and infinite-scroll list populated with all the Trainers that have signed up.
