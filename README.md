# Friends for Pokémon Masters
A simple friend-finding app for the Pokémon Masters mobile game, built in a weekend.

**To Run:** You can't use the app from directly cloning the repo but you can download it from Google Play while the link is still available.

**Screenshots:** Initial sign-up page, and infinite-scroll list populated with some of the Trainers that have signed up.
