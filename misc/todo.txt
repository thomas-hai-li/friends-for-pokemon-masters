immediate:
- store api keys somewhere safe (DO THIS BEFORE INITIAL COMMIT)

todo:

  UI:
  top header:
    - fix height
    - make it look like material design

  UX:
    - dont show signup screen on app-open

  MODERATION:
    - "confirmed as legit" flag for IDs (so that ppl know who to add)
    - rating system

fix for later
- if registered, dont show signup screen on load
- duplicate fetch (temp fix: MAX_FETCH = 100)
